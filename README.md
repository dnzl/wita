# wita - Who is the author?

This is an "icebreaker" game, best suited to do while joining an online meeting where players can talk and discuss while having the game open.

How to play:
* Input your username in the home screen
* Create a new game or join an existing game by assigning a GameId (alphanumeric)
* Invite people to join using the same GameId
* Each player should submit a fact about themselves that the other players do not know about. The weirder the better.
* Once everyone has submitted at least one fact, the Host can start the first round by clicking "Start Game"
* A random fact will be displayed and the players should try to guess who is the author, discussing and sharing stories, their knowledge of the suspected author. Offtopics are encouraged, this is an "icebreaker" game.
* The author of the fact is encouraged to lie and mislead the players to think that someone else is the author
* Each player then should vote for who they think it's the author
* Once everyone has voted, the Host can finish the round by clicking "Reveal author"
* The name of the author will be displayed in everyone's screen and the sidebar scoreboard will reflect winners (those who guessed correctly)
* The Host can then start a new round

Have fun!
